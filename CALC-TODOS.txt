BUTTONS: SEM SHOULD DO SOME OF THE HEAVY LIFTING, NOT IR
BUTTONS: Ir: port to using BSTR
USE VTABLES (SEM, IR) instead of hard coding property setters.

ALL BUTTONS, NOT JUST ONE
  numbering of IR gened code
  instead of main (head)... i dunno, something clever with uuagc to
    flatten the nested stuff

FIXME: Sem: type of Add
FIXME: Ir: type of SAdd, SIdentExpr

controls
  create all controls, not just the first button
  add to symbol table
  properties:
    vtable support (so we're not hard coding each property in the frm header)
    propset on a default property, from code not frm header
    propget on a named property (e.g. .Caption), from code not frm header
  label
  events
    form_load
    button_click (with control index)
  form
    background colour
    scalewidth support
generic method for settings properties of each of the buttons (vtable and api spec for libvbgui?)
data types:
  boolean: logical And
  double: operators */+-
  integer
  string: as variant, Operator &
  variant
  arrays: accessing control array items by index
libvbstd: Format, Left, Instr, MsgBox with buttons and caption
statements:
  if
  select case

msgbox: wrong number of params (changed the example file)

Dim and methods: need to be class level, not global
