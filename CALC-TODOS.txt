ALL BUTTONS, NOT JUST ONE
  addonebuttonandsetcaptionetc - move this into uuagc native code
    so can map for each button, not just the head
  will need uniquer numbering of IR gened code
VTABLE: SEM TO WORK OUT INDEX; IR TO DO SIMPLE LOOKUP
  instead of buttondeterminewidth, buttonsetwidth etc

BUTTONS: Ir: port to using BSTR

FIXME: Sem: type of Add
FIXME: Ir: type of SAdd, SIdentExpr
