data types:
  coercion:
    move into the ast, so the work of Sem is put to good use?  do other compilers do this?
    actually implement.  right now we can only coerce something into itself
  identExpr: fix type in IR.  Actually, probably Sem should provide that
  boolean: logical And (Sem; Ir)
  double: operators */+-
  integer
  string: convert to BSTR, variant string support, Operator &
  variant
  arrays: accessing control array items by index
libvbstd:
  Format
  Left
  Instr
  MsgBox with variants and buttons and caption
statements:
  call: support casting msgbox message string/buttons int to variant
  call: support Missing parameters (remove Sem validation; IR)
  if (Ir)
  select case (Ir)
Dim and methods: need to be instance level, not globals
  i.e. add Me pointer
resources
  exe icon
